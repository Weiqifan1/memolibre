The `app/core` folder in Angular projects is a convention used to house functionality or services that should be **singleton** in nature and used **application-wide**. This folder typically contains logic that applies to the application as a whole, rather than to a specific feature.
### **Purpose of the `app/core` Folder**
1. **Centralized Singleton Services**:
    - Services in the `app/core` folder are usually injected at the root of the app and are accessible globally (application-wide scope).
    - Examples:
        - Authentication services
        - File processing services
        - API communication services
        - Error logging/reporting

2. **Shared Infrastructure Code**:
    - The purpose of the `app/core` folder is to hold essential infrastructure-like logic (e.g., utilities, interceptors, guards, or custom services) without polluting feature-specific modules.
    - Examples:
        - HTTP request interceptors
        - Application-wide guards (e.g., route protection)
        - Custom logger services for debugging

3. **Decouple Cross-Cutting Concerns**:
    - Code in the `app/core` folder is often related to **cross-cutting concerns**. These are not tied to any specific feature but are used across multiple features or modules.
    - Examples:
        - Error handling
        - Global event emitters
        - Global configuration or constants
        - Internationalization logic (e.g., `TranslateModule` configuration)

4. **Prevent Code Duplication**:
    - `app/core` houses reusable code that multiple modules might need. By defining these services, utilities, or other core logic here, you avoid duplicating code in feature modules, improving app maintainability.

5. **Facilitates Lazy Loading**:
    - The `CoreModule` ensures its code is loaded only once in the root module (`AppModule`). This is especially important in Angular when using **lazy-loaded feature modules**, as it eliminates the possibility of multiple instances of singleton services.

### **What Usually Lives in the `app/core` Folder**
The `app/core` folder is used for application-wide logic, and its content usually includes:
1. **Singleton Services**:
    - These are services where only **one instance** should exist throughout the app.
    - Examples:
        - `AuthService`: Handles user authentication and authorization.
        - `FileService`: Processes file uploads or readings for the entire app.
        - `DataService`: Manages global data shared between modules (e.g., file parsing results).

2. **Guards**:
    - Angular route guards that control access to routes or features.
    - Examples:
        - `AuthGuard`: Block unauthorized access to routes.
        - `RoleGuard`: Restrict feature access based on user roles/permissions.

3. **Interceptors**:
    - Angular HTTP interceptors used for handling every HTTP request/response globally.
    - Examples:
        - Add authorization headers to outgoing requests.
        - Handle network errors in a consistent way.

4. **Application Configurations**:
    - Files holding constants, environment settings, or configuration values used app-wide.
    - Examples:
        - API route constants.
        - App-wide settings (like app version, build info, etc.).

    - These constants/services ensure that global configuration stays centralized.

5. **Global Utility Functions**:
    - Shared helper functions such as date formatting, error formatting, or common calculations.

6. **Base Components/Services**:
    - Abstract components or classes that other components can extend.
    - Examples:
        - Abstract base classes for reusable logic across components.

7. **Error Handling/Logger**:
    - A global error handler can be registered within the `CoreModule` to report errors consistently across the app.

8. **Event Emitters or Observables**:
    - Custom subjects or observables (e.g., for a global `LoadingSpinner`) can be added here.

### **What Should NOT Go Into `app/core`**
To avoid misusing the `app/core` folder, here’s what you should NOT put there:
1. **Feature-Specific Code**:
    - Any code tied to a specific feature should stay in its corresponding feature module.
    - Example: If you have a "drag-and-drop" feature, it belongs in a dedicated module (e.g., `file-upload` module, not `Core`).

2. **Components**:
    - The `CoreModule` typically does not include components. Components that are reused across the app should go in the `app/shared` folder.

3. **Heavy Services/Dependencies**:
    - Avoid adding overly complex or feature-specific services in `app/core` that are unlikely to be relevant for the whole application.

4. **Multiple Imports**:
    - The `CoreModule` should only be imported into the root `AppModule`. Avoid importing it into other feature modules, as it violates the singleton pattern.

### **How `app/core` Helps with Best Practices**
- **Singleton Pattern**: Any logic in `CoreModule` will only be instantiated once because the `CoreModule` is imported directly into the root `AppModule` and not lazy-loaded.
- **Maintainability**: By collecting global logic (e.g., authentication, file handling) in one place, your application becomes easier to maintain and extend.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The `app/core` folder separates app-wide concerns (e.g., authentication, exceptions, global state) from feature-specific or reusable components stored in `app/shared`.

### **Example CoreModule**
Here’s an example `CoreModule` implementation:
``` typescript
// src/app/core/core.module.ts
import { NgModule, Optional, SkipSelf } from '@angular/core';
import { HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http';
import { AuthService } from './services/auth.service';
import { ErrorInterceptor } from './interceptors/error.interceptor';

@NgModule({
  // Services are provided here so they are available app-wide
  providers: [
    AuthService,
    {
      provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
      useClass: ErrorInterceptor,
      multi: true,
    },
  ],
})
export class CoreModule {
  constructor(@Optional() @SkipSelf() parentModule: CoreModule) {
    if (parentModule) {
      throw new Error('CoreModule is already loaded. Import it in the AppModule only.');
    }
  }
}
```

You add services like `AuthService` and global interceptors here, ensuring they’re only loaded once and used throughout the app.

### **Conclusion**
The `app/core` folder is essential for maintaining proper structure and best practices in Angular. It provides a home for application-wide functionalities, centralizing them in a scalable and maintainable way. Its main goals are to achieve **separation of concerns**, **singleton management**, and **global logic organization**. By using it correctly, you ensure that your Angular app remains modular, clean, and easy to enhance over time.
